# courses_spec.txt
# ---------------------------------
# One course group specification per line, in the form:
#   <level><letters>: <lessons>
# where:
#   - <level> is a positive integer like 1, 2, 3, ... representing the year/grade.
#   - <letters> is one or more uppercase letters representing groups in that level (e.g., A, ABCDE, ABCDEF).
#   - <lessons> is the number of sessions per week for each group (positive integer).
# Examples:
#   1ABCDE: 2    # Level 1 has groups A,B,C,D,E; each group has 2 sessions per week
#   6ABCDEF: 3   # Level 6 has groups A..F; each group has 3 sessions per week
#   7A: 4        # Level 7 group A has 4 sessions per week
#
# Comments and blank lines are ignored. Lines must not contain extra spaces except around the colon.
# The generator dynamically computes grid capacity from time_slots in school_data.json and chooses the minimal per-slot sharing cap needed; it escalates only if placement fails.
# The same group will never repeat the exact same (weekday, slot_index) pair.
